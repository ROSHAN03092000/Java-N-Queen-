# Java-N-Queen-
The N-Queen Problem is a popular classic puzzle where number of Queens is to be placed in N x N Chessboard (Matrix) such that no Queen can attack any other Queens. Therefore the rule to obtain solution of this problem is as follows:  1) Only one Queen can be placed in a row. 2) Only one Queen can be placed in a column. 3) At any time maximum of one Queen can be placed in diagonals. The Branching factor to solve this problem grows linearly, Hence N-Queen problem can be approached in following ways: Backtracking algorithm which makes use of DFS, Brute force approach and Branch &amp;amp; Bound which makes use of BFS etc. We make use of Backtracking algorithm in-order to get all possible solutions, for optimal solution we can make use of dynamic programming
